🧩 API Versioning Demo Project
This is a demo project that demonstrates how API versioning works in Spring Boot.
In this project, I have implemented API versioning using URL versioning — one of the simplest and most commonly used methods.

🔍 What is API Versioning?
API versioning allows developers to make changes or improvements to an API without breaking existing client integrations.
It ensures that older versions continue to work while new versions can introduce updated logic, fields, or endpoints.
